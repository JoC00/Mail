# Mekong Transboundary DIALOGUE  
Integrated Management Underway in the Mekong River's Cross-Border Regions  

The four member countries of the Mekong River Commission are now strengthening the region's integrated water resource management (IWRM) practices at the national and sub-national levels through five bilateral pilot projects. These projects aim to address transboundary issues in the management of water and natural resources for the sustainable development and improved livelihoods of the communities within the Mekong River basin. 

Among the five projects are a joint communication outreach project for Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake and Thailand's Songkhla Lake basin, a fishery management project in the Mekong and Sekong Rivers of Cambodia and Lao PDR, and a wetland management project in Laos' Xe Bang Hieng and Thailand's Nam Kam regions. Between Cambodia and Viet Nam, there are two water resource management projects being jointly implemented in the Sesan and Srepok Rivers' sub-basins and the Mekong Delta.
